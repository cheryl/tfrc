                   Interesting and useful macros

The *.tf files in this directory contain many interesting and useful
macros.  Some are quite useful, others illustrate useful macro
programming techinques.  Any of the *.tf files can be loaded directly
with /load.  Read the comments at the top of each file for specific
instructions.

                          So what is this?

This is a repository of Cheryl's tf script hooks, triggers and 
bindings. tf script is the custom language of tf, or tinyfugue. 
Tinyfugue is a text-based MUD client. MUDs are Multi-User-Dungeons.
Further info is on wikipedia.

Bar all that: I occasionally play a game called Astaria.  These are 
the controls I use to play it.
